Option1:: When doing from individual sides (This feature is not available and would need to be modified to be executed only on hub)

Step1: Stratos svc account get the IAM permission compute.vpnGateways.use to MGMT hst project
Step2: Create the VPN gateway and tunnels and generate the shared IKEV2 and MD5 Keys and configure the BGP sessions
Step3: CNE svc account take IAM permission compute.vpnGateways.use on stratos hub project
Step4: Create the gateway and tunnels and input the IKEv2 keys and MD5 keys from step 2 and configure the BGP sessions

Option2: Execute from Stratos side
Step1: Stratos SVC account take roles/compute.networkAdmin permission on CNE MGMT hub
Step2: Create GW and tunnels on their side and then configure it on the MGMT side

Option3: Execute from CNE MGMT hub side
Step1: CNE MGMT SVC account take roles/compute.networkAdmin permission on Stratos hub project
Step2: Create GW and tunnels on their side and then configure it on the stratos side

Option4: Create classic VPN on either side (No need of svc account permissions)
Step1: create VG and external IP on CNE MGMT
Step2: create VG and external IP on Stratos and share the external IP to CNE once created
Step3: Create the tunnels with remote peer IP from step 2 and generate the IKEV2 with route based routing (dynamic not supported)
Step4: Share the IKEV2 with Stratos and create the tunnels on stratos end

Option5: Create VPC peering (This is not a transitive connection)
Step1: Create peering connection from CNE MGMT with stratos project ID and VPC network
Step2: Create peering connection from CNE MGMT with CNE details
